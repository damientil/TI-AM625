## Resource tables

PRU cores must be initialized by an outside source. It can be from a processor core running Linux.

PRU resource tables are only used if the PRU firmware is loaded by a processor core running Linux. If the processor core is running Linux kernel 5.4 or earlier, then resource tables are used differently than if the processor core is running Linux kernel 5.10 or later.
